# SwiftUI-Discovery

This is a rather simple application page that provides an overview of how a user interface can be built for an iOS application using SwiftUI. The way in which views can be combined to incorporate certain functions, including customized scroll views in different views of the ContentView, is just a first attempt on my part. If you have any suggestions for improvement, feel free to contribute and add your input to the project
